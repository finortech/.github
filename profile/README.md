## Finor Tech

Thanks for visiting Finor's github page. 

Due to security and non-disclosure concerns, the majority of our work is kept confidential, however we want to share more code here in the future.

For the time being, you can view a notebook that demonstrates how to use optimization to address financial problems in our [public repository](https://github.com/finortech/solving-financial-problems-with-gurobi). We presented a webinar that included this project in association with the Gurobi team; the complete video is [available here](https://www.gurobi.com/events/proven-techniques-for-solving-financial-problems-with-gurobi/).

Follow us on [Medium](https://medium.com/finortech), where we also offer data-related thoughts.
